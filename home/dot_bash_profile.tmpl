# shellcheck shell=bash

# We need to do two things here:

# 1. Ensure bash/env gets run first
# shellcheck source-path=SCRIPTDIR
. "{{ .xdg.config.home }}/bash/env.bash"

# 2. Prevent it from being run later, since we need to use $BASH_ENV for
# non-login non-interactive shells.
# We don't export it, as we may have a non-login non-interactive shell as
# a child.
BASH_ENV=

# 3. Join the spanish inquisition. ;)
# so much for only two things...

# 4. Run bash/login
# shellcheck source-path=SCRIPTDIR
. "{{ .xdg.config.home }}/bash/login.bash"

# 5. Run bash/interactive if this is an interactive shell.
if [ -n "${PS1}" ]; then
  # shellcheck source-path=SCRIPTDIR
  . "{{ .xdg.config.home }}/bash/interactive.bash"
